"TagPro, I love you",11575,13489

"TagPro, I love you",30766,32531
but you're bringing me down.,32632,35200
"TagPro, you're smaller",40500,42638
and you're wasting my time.,42639,45262
"Despite naysaying vets,",49511,51439
blinking pup tiles are fine.,51440,53900
But you refused to make plans,56800,59554
after the AskReddit ban,62070,63743
to grow your player base,66600,68400
and stop this great game from dying.,68401,70918
"TagPro, you're perfect,",75016,76628
"don't, please don't change a thing.",76629,79276
"I'm sorry we didn't support Next,",83170,85150
and made the devs feel like quitting.,85151,88192
But for the years I've invested,90083,93473
I can't not feel disrespected,94177,97660
when I think of what it's become,100075,101817
and what it could have been.,101818,104557
"TagPro, I love you",108128,109776
and I want you to survive.,110194,112795
"With a new push or two,",116016,117895
I think it just might still thrive.,117896,121055

"TagPro, I love you",148047,149858
but you're bringing me down.,149859,152110
Like a death of the heart.,154357,157515
"Jesus, where do I start?",158381,161399
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown.,163575,167824
And oh.. I have to think it's got a chance,170169,175881
But for balls that think it's our last dance,176302,179622
"Yes, for those who think it's our last dance",179812,183086

Maybe dodsfall told us true,206099,209780
and there won't be any more someballs to block for you,210017,212942
while you're carrying alone,212943,214475
but maybe he's wrong,214767,216392
and maybe I'm right and just maybe he's wrong,216540,220487
maybe he's wrong and maybe I'm right,222070,225019
